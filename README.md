Before starting:
Create a new repository for this project called pandas-challenge. Do not add this homework to an existing repository.
Clone the new repository to your computer.
Inside your local Git repository, create a folder for this homework assignment and name it PyCitySchools.

# Hints and Help
Taken into consideration all the hints. I completed pandas-challenge projects by consulting panda documentation, went through all class materials and took some help from xpertlearning.

I encountered some difficulties in getting answer, but I did took time ands study dependencies and did some reaserch where I also learn some of other function. I also tried to apply some new functions which I learned.
